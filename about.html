  <h1>about</h1>
  <p>My name is Erin Cochran. I'm a front-end web developer that's been building webpages for fun since the 1990s, and professionally for around 10 years.</p>
  <p>I started using linux when I was 14 because I got sold a computer with a pirated copy of windows on it and doing a windows update caused a bunch of problems, so I went to a software store (we had those back then) and purchased a bundle of Red Hat Linux disks. The rest is history.</p>
  <p>I enjoy running, riding bikes, self hosting things, collecting vinyl, and tinkering with old computers.</p>
  <p>My current workstation is a ThinkPad P14s running Arch Linux. By the way.</p>
