# erin-cochran.github.io

My personal website hosted at [https://cochran.dev](https://cochran.dev). Hosted
on github pages. Initially forked from [indieweb's](https://indieweb.org/)
[blank-gh-site](https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site) repo. Design ideas
stolen from lots of people I admire.

## Goals for this little page

- Absolutely no builds or libraries, only native web technologies allowed
- Implement as many indieweb technologies as possible
- Fully hand coded
